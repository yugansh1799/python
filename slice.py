# slicing of the string
#lang = "Python"
# print(lang[4])
# syntax [start argument:stop argument-1: step argument] it always prints the string in manner of n-1*
# print (lang[-3:6])
# it is not compulsary tht we have to lang here we can take any string in input*
#print ("yugansh"[1:7])

# step argument can also be added in the slicing part.
# step basically counts the distance and prints n tht order.

#print("yugansh"[1:7:2])
# we can also reverse the string as we want to do.
print("yugansh"[-1::-1])
print("yugansh"[-4::-1])
print("yugansh"[6::-1])
print("yugansh"[::-1]) # trick to reverse string.
